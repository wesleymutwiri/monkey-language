# Monkey Language

This is a Basic Go implementation of Thorsten Ball's "Writing an Interpreter in Go" book. It involves creating an interpreted language in Go that does basic functions. The language will go wider and further by adding a couple of packages in order to make the language more feature rich compared to the one described in the book.

## Features to be Implemented

- [x] Create a lexer
- [x] Create a REPL for evaluating the language
- [x] Create a Parser
- [x] Evaluating Symbols,functions, function calls etc
- [x] Extending the interpreter to include data structures
- [] Adding additional tests
- [ ] Documenting how to use the language
- [ ] Macro systems for the language
- [ ] Other features
- [ ] Writing a compiler for the language
- [ ] Packaging the language as an executable
- [ ] Adding the language to a package registry(e.g snap)

## Reason for the project

The reason for starting the project was just pure curiosity about how interpreters and compilers work and how people create new programming languages and why. The books chosen were due to the fact that I have Go knowledge and because they are well structured and follow a simple enough approach to follow and understand what is going on.

I highly recommend the book for anyone not only Gophers since there are other implementations in different languages.

See [Official Monkey website](https://monkeylang.org/) for implementations in other languages that may be interesting for other developers who are not interested in typing Go code but interested in learning about the monkey language and about interpreters and compilers but in other languages.
